# PRACTICAL QUESTIONS – OOPs CONCEPTS IN PYTHON


# 1. Create a parent class Animal with a method speak() that prints a generic message. Create a child class Dog that overrides the speak() method to print "Bark!".



# 2. Write a program to create an abstract class Shape with a method area(). Derive classes Circle and Rectangle from it and implement the area() method in both.



# 3. Implement a multi-level inheritance scenario where a class Vehicle has an attribute type. Derive a class Car and further derive a class ElectricCar that adds a battery attribute.



# 4. Demonstrate polymorphism by creating a base class Bird with a method fly(). Create two derived classes Sparrow and Penguin that override the fly() method.



# 5. Write a program to demonstrate encapsulation by creating a class BankAccount with private attributes balance and methods to deposit, withdraw, and check balance.



# 6. Demonstrate runtime polymorphism using a method play() in a base class Instrument. Derive classes Guitar and Piano that implement their own version of play().



# 7. Create a class MathOperations with a class method add_numbers() to add two numbers and a static method subtract_numbers() to subtract two numbers.



# 8. Implement a class Person with a class method to count the total number of persons created.
# 9. Write a class Fraction with attributes numerator and denominator. Override the __str__ method to display the fraction as "numerator/denominator".



# 10. Demonstrate operator overloading by creating a class Vector and overriding the __add__ method to add two vectors.



# 11. Create a class Person with attributes name and age. Add a method greet() that prints "Hello, my name is {name} and I am {age} years old."



# 12. Implement a class Student with attributes name and grades. Create a method average_grade() to compute the average of the grades.



# 13. Create a class Rectangle with methods set_dimensions() to set the dimensions and area() to calculate the area.



# 14. Create a class Employee with a method calculate_salary() that computes the salary based on hours worked and hourly rate. Create a derived class Manager that adds a bonus to the salary.



# 15. Create a class Product with attributes name, price, and quantity. Implement a method total_price() that calculates the total price of the product.



# 16. Create a class Animal with an abstract method sound(). Create two derived classes Cow and Sheep that implement the sound() method.



# 17. Create a class Book with attributes title, author, and year_published. Add a method get_book_info() that returns a formatted string with the book's details.



# 18. Create a class House with attributes address and price. Create a derived class Mansion that adds an attribute number_of_rooms.
